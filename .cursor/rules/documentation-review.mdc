# HubHub Project - Mandatory Documentation Review

Before starting ANY development task, feature implementation, or architectural decision, you MUST:

1. **READ AND UNDERSTAND** these core documentation files:
   - @TECHNICAL_APPROACH.md - Current technical architecture, database schema, development strategy
   - @BUSINESS_IDEA.md - Business requirements, MVP features, project scope
   - @CHANGELOG.md - Recent changes and version history

2. **VERIFY ALIGNMENT** with documented requirements and technical decisions
3. **UPDATE DOCUMENTATION** if your task changes any architectural or business decisions
4. **ADD CHANGELOG ENTRIES** for significant modifications

## Context-First Development Rules

### Before Any Code Changes:
- Understand the complete project scope from @BUSINESS_IDEA.md
- Review current technical architecture from @TECHNICAL_APPROACH.md
- Check recent changes in @CHANGELOG.md that might affect implementation
- Ensure consistency with existing database schema and MVP field requirements

### During Development:
- Respect MVP field requirements defined in @TECHNICAL_APPROACH.md
- Follow the three-layer data collection approach (PDF parsing + manual completion + survey)
- Maintain admin-controlled access to designer database
- Focus on PDF CV parsing (NO LinkedIn integration)

### After Development:
- Update relevant documentation files if architectural decisions changed
- Add changelog entries for significant modifications
- Ensure all documentation remains consistent

**CRITICAL: Always check documentation files first, then proceed with implementation while maintaining consistency with established architecture and business requirements.**
