# Changelog Update Rule

## MANDATORY: Update CHANGELOG.md Before Every Commit

Before creating any commit, you MUST:

1. **Update [CHANGELOG.md](mdc:CHANGELOG.md)** in the `[Unreleased]` section
2. **Add appropriate entries** under the correct category:
   - `### Added` - New features, components, or functionality
   - `### Changed` - Changes to existing functionality
   - `### Fixed` - Bug fixes and corrections
   - `### Removed` - Removed features or deprecated functionality
   - `### Security` - Security-related changes

## Changelog Entry Format

### For Feature Commits (`feat:`):
- Add entry under `### Added`
- Be specific about what was implemented
- Reference relevant files or components

### For Bug Fix Commits (`fix:`):
- Add entry under `### Fixed` 
- Describe what was broken and how it was resolved

### For Documentation Commits (`docs:`):
- Add entry under `### Added` or `### Changed` as appropriate
- Mention documentation updates or improvements

### For Refactor/Style Commits:
- Add entry under `### Changed`
- Describe structural or code quality improvements

## Example Changelog Entries:
```markdown
### Added
- User authentication system with email/password login
- Designer profile creation form with CV upload functionality
- Database schema for MVP required fields validation

### Fixed
- Resolved Next.js module loading issues during development
- Fixed TypeScript errors in Supabase server configuration
```

## Commit Process:
1. **Make your code changes**
2. **Update [CHANGELOG.md](mdc:CHANGELOG.md)** with appropriate entries
3. **Stage both code changes AND changelog**: `git add .`
4. **Create commit** with descriptive message
5. **Verify changelog was included** in the commit

## CRITICAL: Never commit without updating the changelog!
Every commit should reflect its changes in [CHANGELOG.md](mdc:CHANGELOG.md) to maintain proper project history and version tracking.
