# HubHub Cursor Workspace Rules

## Script Organization Rule
- **NEVER create SQL scripts (.sql files) in the main project folder**
- **ALL SQL scripts must be placed in the `scripts/` directory**
- This includes debug scripts, migration scripts, test scripts, and any other SQL files
- Exception: Migration files belong in `supabase/migrations/` directory

## File Organization
- Keep the main project folder clean of temporary or debug files
- Use appropriate subdirectories for different types of files:
  - SQL scripts → `scripts/`
  - Migrations → `supabase/migrations/`
  - Documentation → main folder (only if permanent)
  - Test files → appropriate test directories

## Development Workflow
- When creating database debugging or setup scripts, always place them in `scripts/`
- Use descriptive names for scripts to indicate their purpose
- Clean up temporary scripts after debugging is complete
